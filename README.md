# Sharpminds Games Task 2

A optimization based task with the goal of having 500 png images flying across the screen,

## Notes

this is my first time playing around with vue based on the comment from the first task i thought i would give it a shot.

Also i know my solution could technically be optimized bit more by switching the way i handle the animation. Instead of js building the next animation key frame based on the images "collision" with the bounding box i could have made it just a simple css animation but this solution just felt better in my personal opinion so i just kinda ran with it.
